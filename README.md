- **Efficiency and Productivity:** Streamline the request management process to reduce response times and increase overall productivity.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Implement reporting tools for analyzing request data, identifying trends, and making informed decisions to improve services.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive and accessible interface to ensure ease of use for all employees, regardless of technical proficiency.

## Scope
### Inclusions
- **Requirements Gathering:** Conduct meetings with stakeholders from various departments to identify specific needs and preferences for the dashboard.
- **Design and Development:** Design a user-friendly interface and develop the dashboard with features including request submission forms, status tracking, notifications, and reporting capabilities.
- **Testing:** Perform thorough testing of the dashboard, including functionality, usability, and security tests, to ensure reliability and performance.
