I am currently out of town, but unfortunately, our Control4 problems are basically as bad as they were before the last work was done.   The upstairs master bedroom hardly ever works when it is turned on (either from the TV or the Control4), I have a 30 second delay in turning on the gym TV in the morning, and there are other glitches through the house.  In Koah’s defense, he said that this first step (the new equipment in the living room coupled with updating the software) may have been just a kickoff of several updates needed, so I am not upset.  However, it still definitely isn’t right, and we would appreciate having Koah and/or whomever your most senior Control4 technician is come to our house and see if they can work with the system until it’s finally operating correctly.",

The TV in the master bedroom is somehow off the controller system, and we have to use several remote controls to view what we want. I think this is a simple reset, but you know the systems and I do not. \n\nc. About six months ago, I let you know that the north side of the lights hat goes up the front steps blinks on and off. It starts blinking when we turn on those lights. It we leave those lights on for many hours, sometimes the blinking stops. Then it starts again. I wonder if there is some sort of short in one of the wires that makes it do this, it drives us nuts. I wonder if we could figure this out and fix it.",
