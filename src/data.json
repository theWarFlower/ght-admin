The TV in the master bedroom is somehow off the controller system, and we have to use several remote controls to view what we want. I think this is a simple reset, but you know the systems and I do not. \n\nc. About six months ago, I let you know that the north side of the lights hat goes up the front steps blinks on and off. It starts blinking when we turn on those lights. It we leave those lights on for many hours, sometimes the blinking stops. Then it starts again. I wonder if there is some sort of short in one of the wires that makes it do this, it drives us nuts. I wonder if we could figure this out and fix it.",

Control4 went through every single room because there's only a couple that most of our labeled but a couple of them are not labeled but I went through all of them to turn the volume down none of them connected to his room, so I'm not sure if we're missing him on the system or something up. Can you put in a ticket and have someone look into this please he wants to be able to just turn his music off",
