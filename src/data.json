Preset volumes in Exercise Room, Master Bath, Master Bedroom were found to be not working. Did not check system-wide but could be additional locations.\n\n2. iPad in Kitchen is designed to control audio in two separate, nearby zones—the Kitchen, itself plus Dining Area. Individual control of the two separate areas is presently nonexistent. Instead, the touch of each of the two individual volume-control buttons (each set up to control their own respective area [Kitchen or Dining Area]) causes volume to change simultaneously in both areas.\n\n3.

The upstairs master bedroom hardly ever works when it is turned on (either from the TV or the Control4), I have a 30 second delay in turning on the gym TV in the morning, and there are other glitches through the house.  In Koah’s defense, he said that this first step (the new equipment in the living room coupled with updating the software) may have been just a kickoff of several updates needed, so I am not upset.  However, it still definitely isn’t right, and we would appreciate having Koah and/or whomever your most senior Control4 technician is come to our house and see if they can work with the system until it’s finally operating correctly.",

The TV in the master bedroom is somehow off the controller system, and we have to use several remote controls to view what we want. I think this is a simple reset, but you know the systems and I do not. \n\nc. About six months ago, I let you know that the north side of the lights hat goes up the front steps blinks on and off. It starts blinking when we turn on those lights. It we leave those lights on for many hours, sometimes the blinking stops. Then it starts again. I wonder if there is some sort of short in one of the wires that makes it do this, it drives us nuts. I wonder if we could figure this out and fix it.",

Also having some issues with the den tv dropping off the network. It probably has to do with the concrete walls the signal is trying to pass through. We need to figure out a solution. It could require either moving an access point the the area that’s prewired, or transmission boosting within the wap settings nearest the room.",
